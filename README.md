# Inventory-Manager
This is a small personal sideproject of mine.

The app consists of two parts, a web client and a server. 

## Web client
This module is a react based web client.
It will be served by the server.
The communication between client/server will be thru the servers /api route.

## Server
This server will store items in a inventory manager.
It will simulate a warehouse-like structure of items and shelfs/boxes.
MongoDB will be utilized as the storage medium.
Primary language of the server is Python(Flask).
